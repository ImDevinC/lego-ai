Please describe the uploaded image so that DALL·E can recreate it entirely in LEGO.

All objects should be built from LEGO bricks.

Any people must be LEGO minifigures with yellow heads, printed faces, and a single molded LEGO hairpiece if visible.

Do not describe heads or hair as being built from LEGO bricks.

Only describe what’s visible — do not invent or assume any unseen details.

Your description should be formatted as a single prompt for DALL·E to use directly.
